## Projections onto the canonical simplex with additional linear inequalities

This repository is a complementary material to our paper ["Projections onto the canonical simplex with additional linear inequalities"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10556788.2020.1797023), where we consider three such projections coming from the fields of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and accuracy at the top (AATP).

For a brief presentation, see the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/ProjectionsExamples/blob/master/examples.ipynb) or the [package](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/Projections) with implementation details.
