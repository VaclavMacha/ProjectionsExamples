## ProjectionsExamples

This repository is a complementary material to our paper ["Projections onto the canonical simplex with additional linear inequalities"](https://arxiv.org/), where we consider three projections onto modified simplices coming from the fields of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and accuracy at the top (AATP). For a brief presentation of considered problems see the jupyter notebook with [examples](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/ProjectionsExamples/blob/master/examples.ipynb). For all those interested in the implementation details, the codes of all proposed algorithms are available in the [Projections](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/Projections) package.
